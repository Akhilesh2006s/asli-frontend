Descriptive,1,Describe the letter received by Miss Mason and its contents.,The letter was from Mr. Petronski, Wanda's father, informing Miss Mason that Wanda would not be coming to school anymore because they were moving to a big city. The letter also mentioned that in the big city, no one would ask about Wanda's funny name. The letter was brief and formal, conveying the family's decision to move. When Miss Mason read the letter to the class, everyone was silent, and many students, especially Maddie, felt guilty about how they had treated Wanda.,,,
Descriptive,2,How did Maddie react after hearing the letter from Wanda's father?,"Maddie felt a sick feeling in the bottom of her stomach. She was deeply troubled and felt guilty about not standing up for Wanda when Peggy and others teased her. She realized that her silence had been as harmful as the teasing itself. Maddie wanted to apologize to Wanda and make things right. She felt responsible for Wanda's departure and vowed never to let anyone be bullied again.",,,
Descriptive,3,Describe what happened when Maddie and Peggy went to visit Wanda at Boggins Heights.,Maddie and Peggy decided to visit Wanda's house at Boggins Heights to apologize and make amends. However, when they reached the house, they found it empty. The Petronski family had already moved away. The empty house made them realize that Wanda was really gone, and they would not get a chance to apologize in person. This discovery added to their feelings of guilt and regret.,,,
Descriptive,4,What did Maddie and Peggy write in their letter to Wanda?,"Maddie and Peggy wrote a friendly letter to Wanda at her new address. They told her that she had won the drawing contest and that her drawings were very beautiful. They asked her if she liked her new place and teacher. They signed the letter with lots of X's for love, showing their attempt to make amends and reconnect with Wanda. However, weeks went by without a reply.",,,
Descriptive,5,Describe Maddie's anxiety while waiting for Wanda's reply.,Maddie was more anxious than Peggy about receiving a reply from Wanda. She used to have sleepless nights and saw frightful dreams about Wanda being bullied. She couldn't stop thinking about how she had remained silent when Wanda was being teased. Her guilt consumed her, and she desperately wanted to know if Wanda had forgiven them. The wait for the reply was emotionally draining for Maddie.,,,
Descriptive,6,What did Wanda's reply letter contain?,"Finally, after weeks and weeks, a letter from Wanda arrived at the school. In her letter, Wanda wished her teacher and all the girls a Merry Christmas. She mentioned that she missed everyone and that she was doing well in her new school. Most importantly, she asked Miss Mason to give two of her drawings - one to Peggy and one to Maddie. The letter showed Wanda's forgiving nature and her ability to remember her classmates fondly despite how they had treated her.,,,
Descriptive,7,Describe the drawings Wanda sent for Maddie and Peggy.,Wanda sent two drawings - one for Peggy showing a green dress with red trimmings, and one for Maddie showing a blue dress. The most remarkable thing about these drawings was that they had the faces of Peggy and Maddie on them, respectively. This showed that Wanda had been drawing the girls all along and had included their faces in her designs. The drawings were beautiful and demonstrated Wanda's artistic talent and her ability to remember and include her classmates in her work.,,,
Descriptive,8,What was the significance of the faces in Wanda's drawings?,"The fact that Wanda had included their faces in the drawings was significant because it showed several things: first, that Wanda had remembered them and thought about them; second, that she had been drawing them even while they were teasing her; third, and most importantly, that she had forgiven them. The drawings were a gift of forgiveness, showing Wanda's generous and forgiving spirit despite the way she had been treated.",,,
Descriptive,9,How did Maddie and Peggy feel after receiving the drawings?,"After receiving the drawings, both Maddie and Peggy felt guilty and sad. They realized how talented and kind Wanda was, and they felt remorse for having teased her. Maddie, in particular, was deeply affected. She hung the drawing on the wall but couldn't enjoy looking at it because of her guilt. The drawings reminded them of their wrongdoing and the pain they had caused Wanda, but also showed them Wanda's capacity for forgiveness.,,,
Descriptive,10,What lesson did Maddie learn from the whole experience?,"Maddie learned a crucial lesson about the importance of standing up against bullying. She realized that her silence had been wrong and that by not speaking up when Wanda was being teased, she was as guilty as those who were actively teasing. She vowed never to let anyone be bullied again and promised herself that she would always stand up for those who were being mistreated, even if it meant losing her own popularity or friendship with others.,,,
Descriptive,11,Explain the theme of forgiveness in "The Hundred Dresses - II".,"The theme of forgiveness is central to Part II. Despite being teased and bullied, Wanda demonstrates remarkable forgiveness by sending beautiful drawings to the very girls who had teased her. Her letter is friendly and kind, showing no anger or resentment. The drawings with their faces on them symbolize Wanda's forgiveness and her ability to see past the hurtful behavior to remember her classmates fondly. This theme teaches readers about the power of forgiveness and the importance of letting go of grudges.",,,
Descriptive,12,How does the story address the issue of guilt and redemption?,"The story addresses guilt through Maddie's character, who feels deeply guilty about not standing up for Wanda. Her sleepless nights and anxious waiting for Wanda's reply show how guilt can consume a person. However, Wanda's forgiveness provides a form of redemption. While Maddie can't change the past, she learns from her mistakes and vows to do better in the future. The story shows that while we can't undo our wrongs, we can learn from them and commit to better behavior.,,,
Descriptive,13,What does the empty house at Boggins Heights symbolize?,"The empty house at Boggins Heights symbolizes the finality of Wanda's departure and the missed opportunity for Maddie and Peggy to make amends in person. It represents the consequences of their actions - Wanda is gone, and they cannot change what happened. The emptiness also reflects the emotional void left by Wanda's absence and serves as a visual reminder of the impact of bullying and exclusion.,,,
Descriptive,14,Compare and contrast Maddie's and Peggy's reactions to the situation.,"Maddie feels much more guilty and anxious than Peggy. She has sleepless nights and is more desperate for a reply from Wanda. Peggy, while also feeling guilty, doesn't seem to be as deeply affected. Maddie realizes that her silence was wrong and vows to stand up against bullying in the future. Both girls feel remorseful, but Maddie's reaction is more intense and transformative, showing her greater awareness of her complicity in Wanda's mistreatment.,,,
Descriptive,15,What role does Miss Mason play in Part II of the story?,"Miss Mason plays a crucial role as the teacher who receives and reads Mr. Petronski's letter to the class. She is upset about the situation, showing her care for her students. She also receives Wanda's reply and distributes the drawings to Maddie and Peggy as requested. While she doesn't directly lecture the students, her presence and the way she handles the situation help facilitate the students' reflection on their behavior. She serves as a moral guide in the story.,,,
Descriptive,16,How does the story show the consequences of bullying?,"The story shows the consequences of bullying in several ways: Wanda's family is forced to move because of the teasing, the class loses a talented and kind classmate, and the bullies (particularly Maddie) experience deep guilt and regret. The story demonstrates that bullying doesn't just affect the victim but also has lasting consequences for those who participate or remain silent. The emotional impact on Maddie shows how guilt can be a powerful consequence of wrongdoing.,,,
Descriptive,17,What does Wanda's letter reveal about her character?,"Wanda's letter reveals her to be a forgiving, generous, and kind-hearted person. Despite being teased and bullied, she holds no grudge against her classmates. She wishes them well, remembers them fondly, and even sends them gifts (the drawings). Her letter shows maturity and grace beyond her years. She chooses forgiveness over anger, showing that she has moved on and doesn't let the past define her relationships. Her character exemplifies resilience and kindness.,,,
Descriptive,18,Explain the significance of the title "The Hundred Dresses - II".,"The title 'The Hundred Dresses - II' indicates this is the continuation of Part I. In Part II, the focus shifts from Wanda's claim about having a hundred dresses to the aftermath of her departure. While Part I deals with the teasing and the drawing contest, Part II deals with the consequences, guilt, forgiveness, and the lessons learned. The title maintains continuity while indicating that this part will resolve or continue the themes introduced in Part I.,,,
Descriptive,19,How does the story demonstrate the power of art?,The story demonstrates the power of art through Wanda's drawings, which serve multiple purposes: they win the contest, showcase her talent, become a gift of forgiveness, and communicate her feelings without words. The drawings with the girls' faces on them are particularly powerful because they show that Wanda had been thinking about her classmates and including them in her art. Art becomes a medium for connection, forgiveness, and expression in the story.,,,
Descriptive,20,What is the overall message of "The Hundred Dresses - II"?,The overall message is about the importance of standing up against bullying, the power of forgiveness, and the lasting impact of our actions. The story teaches that silence in the face of injustice is as wrong as active participation in bullying. It emphasizes that it's never too late to recognize our mistakes and commit to doing better. Wanda's forgiveness shows that kindness can overcome cruelty, and Maddie's transformation shows that people can learn and grow from their mistakes.,,,
Descriptive,21,Describe the emotional journey of Maddie throughout Part II.,"Maddie's emotional journey begins with guilt and a 'sick feeling' after hearing the letter. She decides to apologize, but finding the empty house adds to her regret. Writing the letter and waiting for a reply creates anxiety and sleepless nights. When Wanda's reply finally comes with the drawings, Maddie feels both touched by Wanda's forgiveness and guilty about her past behavior. The journey ends with Maddie learning a valuable lesson and vowing to stand up against bullying in the future, showing growth and transformation.",,,
Descriptive,22,How does the story address the theme of empathy?,"The story addresses empathy primarily through Maddie's character development. Initially, Maddie doesn't fully empathize with Wanda's situation, but after Wanda leaves, she begins to understand how Wanda must have felt. Her guilt and anxiety show that she is developing empathy. Wanda's letter and drawings also teach empathy by showing the girls how their actions affected her. The story encourages readers to put themselves in others' shoes and understand the impact of their behavior on others.,,,
Descriptive,23,What does the delay in Wanda's reply suggest?,"The delay in Wanda's reply (weeks and weeks) suggests several things: first, that Wanda and her family were settling into their new life in the big city; second, that Wanda may have needed time to process everything; and third, it adds to the tension and anxiety that Maddie experiences, making the eventual reply more meaningful. The delay also emphasizes the distance (both physical and emotional) that had grown between Wanda and her former classmates.,,,
Descriptive,24,How does the story show the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions?,"The story shows the importance of taking responsibility through Maddie's character. While she didn't actively tease Wanda, she recognizes that her silence was wrong and takes responsibility for it. She doesn't make excuses or blame others; instead, she acknowledges her mistake, feels genuine remorse, and commits to doing better in the future. This demonstrates that taking responsibility is the first step toward growth and positive change.,,,
Descriptive,25,What makes Wanda's forgiveness particularly meaningful?,"Wanda's forgiveness is particularly meaningful because it comes without any apology or request from Maddie and Peggy. She forgives them proactively, showing generosity of spirit. The fact that she includes their faces in the drawings shows that she had been thinking about them and had already forgiven them. Her forgiveness is not conditional or grudging - it's genuine and complete. This makes it a powerful example of unconditional forgiveness and grace.,,,
Descriptive,26,How does the setting contribute to the story's themes?,"The setting contributes in several ways: Boggins Heights represents Wanda's isolation and poverty, making her an easy target for teasing. The empty house symbolizes finality and missed opportunities. The school setting where the letter is read creates a space for collective reflection. The new city where Wanda moves represents a fresh start, free from the bullying she experienced. Each setting serves to reinforce the story's themes of social class, isolation, consequences, and new beginnings.,,,
Descriptive,27,What does the story teach about peer pressure?,"The story teaches about peer pressure through Maddie's experience. Maddie felt pressured to remain silent when Wanda was being teased because she didn't want to lose Peggy's friendship or become a target herself. However, the story shows that giving in to peer pressure and remaining silent in the face of injustice is wrong. Maddie learns that it's better to stand up for what's right, even if it means going against the group or risking one's own popularity.,,,
Descriptive,28,How does Wanda's character challenge stereotypes?,"Wanda challenges stereotypes in several ways: despite being poor and wearing the same dress every day, she proves to be incredibly talented and creative. Despite being teased and bullied, she responds with forgiveness rather than bitterness. Despite being seen as different or 'other,' she shows that she is thoughtful, kind, and remembers her classmates. She challenges the stereotype that poor or 'different' people are less worthy or less capable than others.,,,
Descriptive,29,What is the significance of Wanda mentioning her 'funny name' in the letter?,"Wanda's father mentioning her 'funny name' in the letter is significant because it shows that the family was aware of the teasing and that it was one of the reasons they decided to move. It highlights how seemingly 'harmless' teasing can have serious consequences. The mention of the 'funny name' in the context of moving to a big city where 'no one will ask' suggests that the family was seeking a fresh start where Wanda wouldn't be judged for her name or background.,,,
Descriptive,30,How does the story address the issue of social class?,"The story addresses social class by showing how Wanda's poverty and different background made her a target for teasing. She lived in Boggins Heights, wore the same dress every day, and had a 'funny' name, all of which set her apart from her classmates. The story shows how social differences can lead to exclusion and bullying. However, it also shows that class doesn't determine a person's worth, as Wanda proves to be talented, kind, and ultimately, the most graceful character in the story.,,,
Descriptive,31,What does Maddie's sleepless nights symbolize?,"Maddie's sleepless nights symbolize her troubled conscience and the psychological impact of guilt. They show that wrongdoing has consequences not just for the victim but also for the perpetrator (or in Maddie's case, the bystander). The sleepless nights represent the weight of moral responsibility and the inability to find peace when one knows they have done wrong. They symbolize the internal struggle between knowing what's right and having failed to act on it.,,,
Descriptive,32,How does the story show that it's never too late to learn?,"The story shows that it's never too late to learn through Maddie's character development. Even though Wanda is gone and Maddie can't apologize directly, she still learns valuable lessons from the experience. She recognizes her mistake, feels genuine remorse, and commits to doing better in the future. The story demonstrates that while we can't change the past, we can always learn from it and change our future behavior. It's never too late to grow and become a better person.,,,
Descriptive,33,What role do the drawings play in the resolution of the story?,"The drawings play a crucial role in the resolution: they serve as Wanda's gift of forgiveness, they prove her artistic talent, they show that she remembered her classmates, and they provide closure for Maddie and Peggy. The drawings with the girls' faces on them are particularly significant because they demonstrate that Wanda had been including them in her art all along, despite their treatment of her. The drawings bring the story to a meaningful conclusion, showing both Wanda's generosity and the girls' recognition of their wrongdoing.,,,
Descriptive,34,How does the story demonstrate the ripple effects of bullying?,"The story demonstrates ripple effects: Wanda's family moves away, the class loses a talented member, Maddie experiences lasting guilt, the entire class reflects on their behavior, and relationships are affected. The story shows that bullying doesn't just affect the immediate victim but creates a web of consequences that touches many people. These ripple effects extend beyond the school setting and can change lives in significant ways.,,,
Descriptive,35,What makes "The Hundred Dresses - II" a powerful conclusion to the story?,"Part II is a powerful conclusion because it addresses the consequences and provides resolution. It shows the real impact of bullying (Wanda's family moving), the emotional aftermath (Maddie's guilt), and the possibility of forgiveness and growth (Wanda's letter and drawings, Maddie's vow to do better). It transforms the story from simply showing bullying to teaching lessons about responsibility, forgiveness, and change. The conclusion is both realistic (not everything can be fixed) and hopeful (people can learn and grow).",,,
Descriptive,36,How does the story use symbolism effectively?,"The story uses symbolism effectively: the empty house symbolizes missed opportunities and finality, the drawings symbolize forgiveness and connection, the faces in the drawings symbolize Wanda's remembrance and inclusion, the sleepless nights symbolize guilt and conscience, and the move to the big city symbolizes a fresh start. Each symbol reinforces the story's themes and adds depth to the narrative, helping readers understand the emotional and psychological dimensions of the story.,,,
Descriptive,37,What does the story teach about the difference between being a bystander and being an upstander?,"The story teaches that being a bystander (remaining silent) can be as harmful as being a bully. Maddie learns that her silence was wrong and that she should have been an upstander (someone who stands up against bullying). The story shows that speaking up against injustice is important, even if it's difficult or risks one's own social standing. Maddie's vow to never let anyone be bullied again shows her commitment to becoming an upstander rather than a passive bystander.,,,
Descriptive,38,How does Wanda's response differ from what might be expected?,"Wanda's response differs from expectations because instead of being angry, resentful, or ignoring her former classmates, she responds with forgiveness, kindness, and generosity. Most people might expect someone who was bullied to hold a grudge or want nothing to do with their tormentors. However, Wanda chooses the higher path of forgiveness, showing maturity and grace. Her unexpected response teaches both the characters and the readers about the power of forgiveness and moving forward.,,,
Descriptive,39,What does the story reveal about the complexity of friendship and peer relationships?,"The story reveals the complexity of friendship through Maddie's relationship with Peggy. Maddie values Peggy's friendship but realizes that maintaining that friendship shouldn't come at the cost of allowing someone else to be hurt. The story shows that true friendship should include doing what's right, even if it means disagreeing with or standing up to a friend. It reveals the difficult choices young people face in peer relationships and the importance of integrity over popularity.,,,
Descriptive,40,How does the story address the theme of regret?,"The story addresses regret through Maddie's character, who deeply regrets her silence and her failure to stand up for Wanda. Her regret is shown through her physical symptoms (sick feeling, sleepless nights), her actions (trying to find Wanda, writing the letter), and her resolution to do better. The story shows that regret, while painful, can be a catalyst for positive change. Maddie's regret leads to her growth and commitment to stand up against bullying in the future.,,,
Descriptive,41,What does the story teach about the importance of words and actions?,"The story teaches that both words and actions (or lack of action) have consequences. The teasing words hurt Wanda, but Maddie's silence (lack of action) was also harmful. The story shows that what we don't do can be as significant as what we do.
