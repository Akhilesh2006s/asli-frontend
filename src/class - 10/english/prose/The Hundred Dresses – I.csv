Descriptive,1,Describe Wanda Petronski's character and her situation in the story.,"Wanda Petronski is a Polish immigrant girl who lives in Boggins Heights, a poor area. She is quiet, isolated, and sits in the last row of the classroom. She wears the same faded blue dress every day, which symbolizes her poverty. Despite being teased about her unusual name and her claim of having one hundred dresses, Wanda remains dignified and doesn't respond to the teasing. She is revealed to be a talented artist whose drawings of one hundred different dresses prove that her claim was based on her rich imagination and creativity, not lies. Her character represents resilience, talent, and the dignity of those who are marginalized.",,,
Descriptive,2,Explain the relationship between Peggy and Maddie and their role in bullying Wanda.,"Peggy is the most popular girl in school who leads the teasing of Wanda. She asks Wanda about her dresses every day, not out of malice but out of curiosity and what she thinks is harmless fun. Maddie is Peggy's best friend who is also poor like Wanda. Maddie feels uncomfortable when Peggy teases Wanda because she sees herself in Wanda's situation. However, Maddie remains silent because she fears that if she speaks up, she might become the next target. This relationship shows how peer pressure and fear can make bystanders complicit in bullying, even when they know it's wrong.",,,
Descriptive,3,What is the significance of the drawing contest in the story?,"The drawing contest is a turning point in the story. When Wanda submits one hundred different dress designs, all beautifully drawn and unique, it reveals her true talent and proves that her claim about having one hundred dresses was based on her imagination and creativity, not lies. The contest becomes Wanda's moment of triumph, as she wins the competition for girls. It forces the other students, especially Peggy and Maddie, to see Wanda in a new light and realize the impact of their teasing. The contest serves as a revelation that challenges the students' assumptions about Wanda and highlights the power of art as a form of self-expression.",,,
Descriptive,4,How does the story address the theme of bullying and its consequences?,"The story addresses bullying through the daily teasing Wanda endures about her name and her claim of having one hundred dresses. The students justify their behavior as 'harmless fun,' but the story shows that even seemingly innocent teasing can be hurtful. The consequences are revealed through Maddie's guilt after Wanda leaves, showing that bullying affects not just the victim but also those who witness it and remain silent. The story emphasizes that staying silent is as bad as participating in bullying, teaching readers about the importance of standing up for others and the lasting impact of our actions on others.",,,
Descriptive,5,Describe Maddie's internal conflict and what she learns from the experience.,"Maddie experiences a deep internal conflict throughout the story. She is poor like Wanda and feels uncomfortable when Peggy teases Wanda, seeing herself in Wanda's situation. However, she remains silent because she fears becoming the next target if she speaks up. After Wanda leaves and wins the drawing contest, Maddie feels guilty for not standing up for Wanda. She realizes that her silence made her complicit in the bullying. Maddie learns that staying silent in the face of injustice is as harmful as participating in it, and she resolves to never again remain silent when someone is being mistreated.",,,
Descriptive,6,What does Wanda's claim about having one hundred dresses reveal about her character?,"Wanda's claim about having one hundred dresses reveals her rich imagination, creativity, and her way of coping with poverty and isolation. While the other students see it as a lie, it's actually a reflection of her artistic talent and her ability to dream and create beauty despite her circumstances. When she submits one hundred different dress designs for the drawing contest, she proves that her claim was based on her imagination - she had indeed 'created' one hundred dresses through her drawings. This reveals her resilience, creativity, and her ability to find beauty and expression even in difficult circumstances.",,,
Descriptive,7,How does the setting of Boggins Heights contribute to the story?,"Boggins Heights is a poor, isolated area where Wanda lives, which emphasizes her social and economic isolation. The setting highlights the contrast between Wanda's poverty and the relative comfort of the other students. It also explains why Wanda is different - she comes from a marginalized community, which makes her an easy target for teasing. The setting contributes to the theme of social class and how economic differences can lead to bullying and exclusion. It also emphasizes Wanda's isolation, as she lives far from the other students and doesn't have the same social connections.",,,
Descriptive,8,Explain the role of Miss Mason in the story.,"Miss Mason is the teacher who represents kindness, fairness, and moral guidance in the story. She promotes a positive classroom environment and encourages students to be kind to one another. While she may not be fully aware of the extent of the teasing Wanda faces, her character represents the adult authority figure who should be protecting students from bullying. Her presence suggests that teachers have a responsibility to create inclusive environments and address bullying. Miss Mason's character serves as a contrast to the students' behavior and represents the values that should guide their interactions.",,,
Descriptive,9,What is the significance of Wanda's blue dress?,"Wanda's blue dress, which she wears every day, is a powerful symbol of her poverty and her family's economic situation. The fact that she has only one dress to wear daily makes her an easy target for teasing, as the other students notice her lack of variety in clothing. However, the dress also becomes a symbol of her dignity - despite having only one dress, she keeps it clean and wears it with pride. The blue dress represents both her poverty and her resilience, showing that material possessions don't define a person's worth or talent.",,,
Descriptive,10,How does the story challenge stereotypes about poverty and talent?,"The story challenges stereotypes by showing that Wanda, despite being poor and marginalized, possesses exceptional artistic talent. The students assume that because Wanda is poor and wears the same dress every day, she must be lying about having one hundred dresses. However, the story reveals that poverty doesn't limit creativity or talent. Wanda's rich imagination and artistic ability prove that talent and creativity are not dependent on wealth. The story challenges the assumption that poor people are less capable or less creative, showing that Wanda's poverty actually fueled her imagination and artistic expression.",,,
Descriptive,11,Describe how Peggy's character develops throughout the story.,"Peggy starts as the popular girl who leads the teasing of Wanda, thinking it's harmless fun. She doesn't realize the impact of her actions on Wanda. However, after Wanda leaves and wins the drawing contest, Peggy begins to understand the consequences of her behavior. She feels remorse and writes a letter to Wanda to make amends. Peggy's character development shows that people can change and learn from their mistakes. Her evolution from a thoughtless teaser to someone who recognizes her wrongdoing and tries to make amends demonstrates the possibility of growth and empathy.",,,
Descriptive,12,What does the story teach about the importance of standing up for others?,"The story teaches that standing up for others is essential, even when it's difficult. Maddie's silence, though motivated by fear, makes her complicit in the bullying. The story emphasizes that bystanders have a responsibility to speak up against injustice. It shows that staying silent can be as harmful as participating in bullying. The story encourages readers to find the courage to stand up for those who are being mistreated, even if it means risking becoming a target themselves. It teaches that moral courage is important and that we all have a responsibility to protect those who are vulnerable.",,,
Descriptive,13,How does the story portray the theme of empathy?,"The story portrays empathy through Maddie's character, who can relate to Wanda's situation because she is also poor. However, the story also shows how fear can prevent empathy from leading to action. Maddie feels for Wanda but doesn't act on her feelings.

The story teaches that understanding and relating to others' experiences should motivate us to treat them with kindness and stand up for them.",,,

It's a moment of triumph for Wanda, who finally receives recognition for her abilities. For the other students, especially Peggy and Maddie, it's a moment of realization and guilt.

Descriptive,15,How does the story address peer pressure and its influence on behavior?,"The story addresses peer pressure through Maddie's character.

Her silence also allows her to focus on what matters to her - her art and her imagination. It shows that she has a strong sense of self-worth that isn't dependent on others' approval or acceptance. Her dignified silence contrasts with the students' thoughtless chatter and highlights her maturity.",,,
Descriptive,17,Explain how the story uses art as a form of self-expression and communication.,"The story uses art as a powerful form of self-expression for Wanda. Through her drawings of one hundred dresses, Wanda communicates her dreams, creativity, and inner world. Her art becomes a way for her to express herself when words fail or when she chooses not to speak. The drawings reveal her true self - talented, creative, and full of imagination. Art becomes her voice, allowing her to show who she really is without having to defend herself verbally. The story demonstrates that art can be a powerful tool for self-expression, especially for those who feel marginalized or silenced.",,,

Descriptive,19,How does the story depict the consequences of bullying on the victim?,"The story depicts the consequences of bullying through Wanda's experience. While Wanda doesn't explicitly show the emotional impact, her isolation, her position in the last row, and her eventual departure suggest the toll the teasing takes on her. However, the story also shows Wanda's resilience - she doesn't let the bullying destroy her spirit or her creativity. The more explicit consequences are shown through Maddie's guilt, suggesting that the impact of bullying extends beyond the immediate victim and affects the entire school community. The story implies that bullying can lead to isolation, emotional pain, and the victim's withdrawal from social situations.",,,
Descriptive,20,Describe the significance of Wanda's name in the story.,"Wanda's unusual Polish name, Petronski, makes her stand out and become a target for teasing. The name represents her difference - she is an immigrant, she is Polish, and she doesn't fit into the mainstream culture of the school. The difficulty other students have pronouncing or remembering her name symbolizes their unwillingness to accept her as she is. Her name becomes a marker of her 'otherness' and a reason for exclusion. However, by the end, the story suggests that what makes her different (her name, her background) is also what makes her unique and special.",,,
Descriptive,21,How does the story show the difference between harmless fun and hurtful teasing?,"The story shows that what students consider 'harmless fun' can actually be hurtful teasing. Peggy and the other students don't think they're being mean - they see their questions about Wanda's dresses as innocent curiosity. However, the story reveals that this 'harmless fun' makes Wanda uncomfortable, isolates her, and contributes to her feeling like an outsider. The story teaches that the impact of our actions matters more than our intentions. It shows that we need to be aware of how our words and actions affect others, even when we don't mean to be hurtful.",,,
Descriptive,22,What role does imagination play in Wanda's life?,"Imagination plays a crucial role in Wanda's life as a coping mechanism and a form of escape. Through her imagination, she creates one hundred beautiful dresses that she can't have in reality. Her imagination allows her to transcend her poverty and create beauty and variety in her life. It's also through her imagination that she expresses her artistic talent, turning her dreams into drawings. Imagination becomes her way of dealing with isolation, poverty, and exclusion. It shows that creativity and imagination can be powerful tools for resilience and self-expression, even in difficult circumstances.",,,
Descriptive,23,How does the story address the issue of social class and economic differences?,"The story addresses social class through the contrast between Wanda's poverty and the relative comfort of other students. Wanda's single blue dress, her home in Boggins Heights, and her family's economic situation mark her as different. The story shows how economic differences can lead to exclusion and bullying. However, it also challenges the assumption that poverty means lack of talent or worth. Wanda's artistic talent proves that economic status doesn't determine a person's abilities or value. The story suggests that we should look beyond economic differences and recognize the worth and talent in everyone.",,,
Descriptive,24,What does Maddie's resolution to never remain silent again signify?,"Maddie's resolution to never remain silent again signifies her growth and learning from the experience. It shows that she has learned the important lesson that silence in the face of injustice is complicity. Her resolution represents moral growth and the development of courage. It suggests that she will now stand up for others, even if it means risking becoming a target herself. This resolution is significant because it shows that people can learn from their mistakes and commit to doing better in the future. It represents hope that individuals can change and that lessons can be learned from difficult experiences.",,,
Descriptive,25,How does the story use the motif of dresses to convey its message?,"The motif of dresses is central to the story's message. The 'hundred dresses' represent Wanda's dreams, creativity, and imagination. They symbolize what she can't have materially but can create through art. The dresses also become a point of conflict - the students tease her about them, not realizing they represent her inner world. When Wanda's drawings reveal one hundred different, beautiful dress designs, the dresses become symbols of her talent and proof that her claim was based on truth. The motif shows that what seems like a lie can actually be truth expressed through creativity and imagination.",,,
Descriptive,26,Describe how the story creates awareness about bullying prevention.,"The story creates awareness about bullying prevention by showing the different roles people play - the bully (Peggy), the victim (Wanda), and the bystander (Maddie). It shows that all these roles matter and that bystanders have a responsibility to act. The story demonstrates that bullying can be subtle - it doesn't have to be physical violence. It shows the importance of empathy, understanding, and standing up for others. By showing the consequences through Maddie's guilt, it encourages readers to think about their own behavior and the impact of their actions or inactions on others.",,,
Descriptive,27,What does the story reveal about the power of art to communicate truth?,"The story reveals that art can communicate truth in ways that words cannot. Wanda's drawings of one hundred dresses communicate the truth of her imagination, her dreams, and her creativity. Through art, she expresses who she really is without having to defend herself verbally. The drawings reveal the truth that she had indeed 'created' one hundred dresses in her mind and on paper. Art becomes a powerful form of communication that transcends language barriers, social differences, and misunderstandings. It shows that art can reveal inner truths and help others understand us better.",,,
Descriptive,28,How does the story show that everyone has a story worth understanding?,"The story shows that everyone has a story worth understanding through Wanda's character. Initially, the students see only Wanda's poverty, her unusual name, and her claim about dresses. They don't try to understand her or see beyond surface appearances. However, when her drawings are revealed, they begin to understand her story - her creativity, her dreams, her way of coping with poverty through imagination. The story teaches that we should take time to understand others' stories before judging them. It shows that everyone has depth, talent, and worth that may not be immediately visible.",,,
Descriptive,29,What is the significance of Wanda leaving the school?,"Wanda leaving the school is significant because it represents the ultimate consequence of the bullying and exclusion she faced. Her departure happens before the students can fully appreciate her talent or make amends, which adds to Maddie's guilt. It shows that bullying can drive people away and that opportunities for reconciliation can be lost. Wanda's departure also serves as a wake-up call for the students, making them realize the impact of their actions. It emphasizes that we should treat people with kindness while they're still with us, not wait until it's too late to appreciate them.",,,
Descriptive,30,How does the story address the theme of regret and making amends?,"The story addresses regret through Maddie's feelings of guilt after Wanda leaves. Maddie regrets not standing up for Wanda when she had the chance. Peggy also tries to make amends by writing a letter to Wanda. The story shows that regret can be a powerful teacher, but it also suggests that it's better to do the right thing in the first place rather than regret it later. The story teaches that we should act with kindness and stand up for others in the moment, not wait until we feel regret to change our behavior.",,,
Descriptive,31,What does the story teach about the importance of looking beyond appearances?,"The story teaches that we should look beyond appearances to see people's true worth and talent. The students judge Wanda based on her poverty, her single dress, and her unusual name, assuming she's lying about having one hundred dresses. However, when they see her drawings, they realize they had misjudged her. The story shows that appearances can be deceiving and that people often have hidden talents, dreams, and worth that aren't immediately visible. It teaches us to be open-minded and to give people the benefit of the doubt rather than making assumptions based on surface appearances.",,,
Descriptive,32,How does the story portray the complexity of bullying situations?,"The story portrays bullying as complex by showing that Peggy doesn't intend to be mean - she thinks she's just having fun. This shows that bullying isn't always malicious; sometimes it's thoughtless or based on ignorance. The story also shows the complexity through Maddie's situation - she knows the teasing is wrong but remains silent out of fear. This complexity makes the story more realistic and relatable. It shows that bullying situations are often nuanced and that good people can participate in or enable bullying without realizing the full impact of their actions.",,,
Descriptive,33,What does the story reveal about the relationship between poverty and creativity?,"The story reveals that poverty doesn't limit creativity; in fact, it can fuel it. Wanda's poverty and lack of material possessions lead her to use her imagination to create the dresses she can't have. Her creativity becomes a way of coping with and transcending her circumstances. The story challenges the assumption that creativity requires wealth or resources.
