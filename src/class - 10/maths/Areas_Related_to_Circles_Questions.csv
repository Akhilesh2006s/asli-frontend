But wait, let me recalculate: 77 = (θ/360) × 154, θ = (77 × 360)/154 = (77 × 360)/(154) = (1/2) × 360 = 180°. Actually, for 77 cm² with r = 7, (θ/360) × 154 = 77, θ = 180°. But let me check: Area of semicircle = 77 cm². So angle = 180°. However, the problem might expect a different answer. Let me recalculate: If area = 77 and r = 7, then (θ/360) × (22/7) × 49 = 77, (θ/360) × 154 = 77, θ = 180°. But typically sectors are less than 180°. Let me try: Maybe it's 90°? (90/360) × 154 = 38.5, not 77. Actually, 77 = (θ/360) × 154 gives θ = 180°. Answer: 180° (or it could be a semicircle)",,,,
