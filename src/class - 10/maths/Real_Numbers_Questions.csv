Let p = 3k. Then 9k² = 3q², so q² = 3k². This means 3 divides q², so 3 divides q. But then 3 divides both p and q, contradicting HCF(p, q) = 1. Therefore, √3 is irrational.",,,,
Problem,33,Show that 5 - √3 is irrational.,"Assume 5 - √3 is rational. Then 5 - √3 = p/q, where p, q are integers, q ≠ 0. Then -√3 = p/q - 5 = (p - 5q)/q, so √3 = (5q - p)/q.

Problem,41,Prove that √7 is irrational.,"Assume √7 is rational. Then √7 = p/q where p, q are integers, q ≠ 0, and HCF(p, q) = 1. Then 7 = p²/q², so p² = 7q². This means 7 divides p², so 7 divides p. Let p = 7k. Then 49k² = 7q², so q² = 7k². This means 7 divides q², so 7 divides q. But then 7 divides both p and q, contradicting HCF(p, q) = 1. Therefore, √7 is irrational.",,,,
