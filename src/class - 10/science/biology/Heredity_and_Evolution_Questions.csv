Performed pea plant experiments, discovered inheritance laws, introduced dominant/recessive traits, laid foundation of genetics",,,,
Descriptive,4,Explain Mendel's monohybrid cross experiment.,"Mendel crossed pure tall (TT) with pure dwarf (tt) pea plants. P generation: TT × tt. F1 generation: All tall (Tt) - showed dominance. F2 generation: 3 tall : 1 dwarf (phenotypic ratio 3:1), genotypic ratio 1:2:1 (TT:Tt:tt). Conclusion: Traits are controlled by factors (genes), factors occur in pairs, one factor (dominant) masks the other (recessive). Answer: Crossed TT × tt. F1: All tall (Tt). F2: 3 tall : 1 dwarf. Shows dominance and segregation",,,,
Descriptive,5,Explain Mendel's law of segregation.,"Law of Segregation: 1) Factors (genes) occur in pairs, 2) During gamete formation, the two factors segregate (separate), 3) Each gamete receives only one factor, 4) Gametes are pure for the factor, 5) At fertilization, factors combine randomly. Example: Tt produces gametes with either T or t, not both. This explains 3:1 ratio in F2 generation. Answer: Factors occur in pairs, segregate during gamete formation, each gamete gets one factor, combine randomly at fertilization",,,,
Descriptive,6,Explain Mendel's law of independent assortment.,"Law of Independent Assortment: 1) When two pairs of contrasting traits are considered together, 2) The factors for each trait assort independently, 3) Inheritance of one trait does not affect inheritance of another, 4) Produces new combinations. Example: In dihybrid cross (round-yellow × wrinkled-green), factors for shape and color assort independently. F2 ratio: 9:3:3:1. Answer: Factors for different traits assort independently, inheritance of one trait doesn't affect another, produces new combinations",,,,
Descriptive,7,What are dominant and recessive traits? Give examples.,"Dominant trait: Expresses itself in presence of recessive trait, represented by capital letter. Example: Tallness (T), round seeds, yellow color. Recessive trait: Does not express in presence of dominant, represented by small letter. Example: Dwarfness (t), wrinkled seeds, green color.
