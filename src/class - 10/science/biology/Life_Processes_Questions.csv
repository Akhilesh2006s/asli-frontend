Descriptive,41,Explain the process of gas exchange in alveoli.,"Gas exchange in alveoli: 1) Alveoli have thin walls (one cell thick), large surface area, 2) Rich blood supply (capillaries), 3) O₂ diffuses from alveoli (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), 4) CO₂ diffuses from blood (high) to alveoli (low), 5) Haemoglobin binds O₂, 6) Efficient due to large surface area and thin walls. Answer: O₂ diffuses from alveoli to blood, CO₂ diffuses from blood to alveoli. Thin walls, large surface area, rich blood supply ensure efficiency",,,,
Descriptive,42,What is the difference between ingestion, digestion, absorption, and egestion?,"Differences: Ingestion: Taking in food through mouth. Digestion: Breaking down complex food into simpler substances using enzymes. Absorption: Taking up digested nutrients into blood/lymph through intestinal wall. Egestion: Elimination of undigested food (feces). Sequence: Ingestion → Digestion → Absorption → Assimilation → Egestion. Answer: Ingestion (taking in), Digestion (breaking down), Absorption (taking up nutrients), Egestion (eliminating undigested)",,,,
Descriptive,43,Explain why the left ventricle has thicker walls than the right ventricle.,"Left ventricle has thicker walls because: 1) It pumps blood to entire body (systemic circulation), 2) Needs to generate higher pressure, 3) Overcomes greater resistance, 4) Works harder. Right ventricle: Pumps only to lungs (pulmonary circulation), less pressure needed, shorter distance, thinner walls. Thickness reflects the work done. Answer: Left pumps to entire body (high pressure needed), right pumps only to lungs (less pressure). Thickness reflects work done",,,,
Descriptive,44,What is the importance of blood clotting?,"Importance of blood clotting: 1) Prevents excessive blood loss from wounds, 2) Seals wounds, 3) Prevents entry of pathogens, 4) Platelets and clotting factors involved, 5) Forms scab, 6) Essential for survival. Process: Platelets clump, release chemicals, fibrin forms mesh, traps blood cells, forms clot. Without clotting, even small cuts would be fatal. Answer: Prevents blood loss, seals wounds, prevents infection. Platelets and clotting factors form fibrin mesh, traps cells, forms clot",,,,
Descriptive,45,Explain how the human body maintains temperature.,"Temperature maintenance: 1) Normal body temperature ~37°C, 2) Heat production: Metabolic reactions, muscle activity, 3) Heat loss: Through skin (sweating, radiation), through lungs (breathing), 4) Regulation: Hypothalamus (brain) controls, 5) Sweating cools body, 6) Shivering produces heat, 7) Blood vessels dilate (cool) or constrict (warm). Homeostasis maintains constant temperature. Answer: Heat from metabolism, loss through skin/lungs. Hypothalamus regulates. Sweating cools, shivering warms. Blood vessels adjust. Maintains ~37°C",,,,
