Example: Fear causes nervous response and adrenaline release. Answer: Nervous: Fast responses. Endocrine: Sustained responses. Hypothalamus controls pituitary. They complement each other. Stress involves both systems",,,,
Descriptive,22,What is feedback mechanism? Explain with example of insulin.,"Feedback mechanism is regulation where output affects input. Example - Insulin: 1) High blood glucose → Stimulates pancreas → Insulin secreted → Glucose decreases → Stops insulin secretion (negative feedback), 2) Low blood glucose → Stimulates pancreas → Glucagon secreted → Glucose increases → Stops glucagon secretion. This maintains homeostasis (stable internal environment). Most hormones use negative feedback. Answer: Output affects input.

Controls most body functions",,,,
Descriptive,27,Explain how roots show positive geotropism.,"Roots show positive geotropism: 1) Root tip has statocytes (gravity-sensing cells), 2) Gravity causes auxin to accumulate on lower side, 3) In roots, high auxin inhibits growth, 4) Lower side grows less, upper side grows more, 5) Root bends downward (positive geotropism). This ensures roots grow into soil for water and minerals. Opposite to shoots.
