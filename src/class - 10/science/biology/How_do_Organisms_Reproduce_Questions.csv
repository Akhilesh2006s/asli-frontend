In sexual reproduction, DNA from both parents combines. DNA is the blueprint of life. Answer: Carries genetic information, passed to offspring, determines characteristics, replicates before division, ensures continuity, mutations cause variation",,,,
Descriptive,42,Explain the advantages of vegetative propagation in agriculture.,"Advantages in agriculture: 1) Produces identical plants (preserves desirable traits), 2) Faster than seeds, 3) No need for pollination, 4) Plants bear fruits earlier, 5) Can propagate seedless varieties, 6) Maintains hybrid characteristics, 7) Economically beneficial. Examples: Grafting in fruit trees, tissue culture, cuttings. Used extensively in horticulture. Answer: Identical plants, faster, no pollination needed, earlier fruiting, seedless varieties, maintains hybrids, economically beneficial. Used in horticulture",,,,
Descriptive,43,What is the difference between internal and external fertilization?,"Internal fertilization: 1) Fusion occurs inside female body, 2) Requires copulation, 3) More protection for gametes, 4) Higher success rate, 5) Fewer gametes needed, 6) Examples: Mammals, birds, reptiles. External fertilization: 1) Fusion occurs outside body (in water), 2) No copulation, 3) Less protection, 4) Lower success rate, 5) Many gametes needed, 6) Examples: Fish, frogs, most aquatic animals. Answer: Internal: Inside body, requires copulation, more protection, higher success. External: Outside body (water), no copulation, less protection, many gametes needed",,,,
Descriptive,44,Explain the importance of reproductive health education.,"Importance: 1) Awareness about reproductive system, 2) Understanding of changes during puberty, 3) Knowledge about contraception, 4) Prevention of STDs, 5) Safe sex practices, 6) Family planning, 7) Reduces myths and misconceptions, 8) Empowers individuals, 9) Reduces teenage pregnancies, 10) Better health outcomes. Should start at appropriate age. Answer: Awareness about reproduction, understanding puberty, contraception knowledge, STD prevention, safe sex, family planning, reduces myths, empowers individuals",,,,
Descriptive,45,What is the difference between embryo and fetus?,"Embryo: 1) Early stage of development, 2) First 8 weeks of pregnancy, 3) All major organs begin forming, 4) Very small, 5) Rapid cell division, 6) Vulnerable stage. Fetus: 1) Later stage of development, 2) From 9 weeks to birth, 3) Organs continue developing and maturing, 4) Grows in size, 5) Can move, 6) More developed. Embryo becomes fetus at 9 weeks. Answer: Embryo: Early stage (first 8 weeks), organs begin forming. Fetus: Later stage (9 weeks to birth), organs mature, grows in size",,,,
Descriptive,46,Explain the process of spermatogenesis.,"Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm formation. Process: 1) Occurs in seminiferous tubules of testes, 2) Starts at puberty, 3) Spermatogonia (diploid) divide by mitosis, 4) Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I, 5) Secondary spermatocytes (haploid) form, 6) Meiosis II produces spermatids, 7) Spermatids mature into spermatozoa (sperm), 8) Takes about 74 days. Continuous process. Answer: Sperm formation in testes. Process: Spermatogonia divide, meiosis produces haploid cells, mature into sperm. Continuous from puberty",,,,
Descriptive,47,Explain the process of oogenesis.,"Oogenesis is the process of egg (ovum) formation. Process: 1) Occurs in ovaries, 2) Starts before birth, 3) Oogonia (diploid) divide, 4) Primary oocytes form, 5) Meiosis I starts but pauses, 6) At puberty, one oocyte completes meiosis I each month, 7) Secondary oocyte and polar body form, 8) Meiosis II completes after fertilization, 9) Mature ovum forms.
