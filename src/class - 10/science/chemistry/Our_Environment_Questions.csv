They are autotrophs and form the first trophic level. Examples: Green plants, algae, some bacteria. They are the primary source of energy in an ecosystem. Answer: Organisms that make their own food. Examples: Green plants, algae. Form first trophic level",,,,
Problem,3,What are consumers? Explain the types.,"Consumers are organisms that cannot make their own food and depend on producers or other consumers for food. Types: 1) Primary consumers (Herbivores) - eat plants (e.g., rabbit, goat, deer). 2) Secondary consumers (Carnivores) - eat primary consumers (e.g., snake, lion). 3) Tertiary consumers (Top carnivores) - eat secondary consumers (e.g., eagle, tiger). Omnivores eat both plants and animals. Answer: Organisms that depend on others for food. Types: Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, at different trophic levels",,,,
Problem,4,What are decomposers? Give examples and explain their importance.,"Decomposers are organisms that break down dead organic matter into simpler substances. Examples: Bacteria and fungi. Importance: 1) Recycle nutrients back to soil, 2) Clean up dead matter, 3) Help in nutrient cycling, 4) Essential for ecosystem functioning. Without decomposers, dead matter would accumulate and nutrients would not be recycled. Answer: Organisms that break down dead matter. Examples: Bacteria, fungi. Important for nutrient recycling",,,,
Problem,5,What is a food chain? Give an example.,"A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which energy flows as each organism eats the one below it. Example: Grass → Rabbit → Snake → Eagle. In this: Grass (producer) is eaten by Rabbit (herbivore), Rabbit is eaten by Snake (carnivore), Snake is eaten by Eagle (top carnivore). Arrows show direction of energy flow. Answer: Linear sequence showing energy flow. Example: Grass → Rabbit → Snake → Eagle",,,,

Answer: Converting organic waste to compost. Benefits: Reduces waste, produces fertilizer, improves soil, environmentally friendly",,,,
Problem,21,Explain why the number of trophic levels in a food chain is limited.,"The number of trophic levels is limited because: 1) Energy decreases at each level (only 10% transferred), 2) After 3-4 levels, very little energy remains, 3) Not enough energy to support more levels, 4) Longer chains are less efficient, 5) Usually limited to 3-4 trophic levels. Example: If level 1 has 10000 J, level 4 has only 1 J. Answer: Energy decreases significantly (10% transfer), after 3-4 levels very little energy remains",,,,
Problem,22,What happens to the energy that is not transferred to the next trophic level?,"The energy not transferred (about 90%) is: 1) Used for metabolic processes (respiration, movement, growth), 2) Lost as heat during these processes, 3) Used for maintaining body functions, 4) Lost through waste products, 5) Cannot be recovered or recycled. This is why energy flow is unidirectional and energy decreases at each level. Answer: Used for metabolic processes, lost as heat, used for body functions, cannot be recovered",,,,

Wetlands are crucial for ecosystem health. Answer: Filter water, prevent floods, provide habitat, store water, recharge groundwater, support biodiversity",,,,
Problem,43,Explain how agricultural practices affect the environment.,"Effects of agricultural practices: 1) Use of pesticides - pollutes soil and water, harms non-target organisms, 2) Fertilizers - cause water pollution (eutrophication), 3) Monoculture - reduces biodiversity, 4) Deforestation for agriculture, 5) Water consumption, 6) Soil degradation. Solutions: Organic farming, crop rotation, integrated pest management. Answer: Pesticides and fertilizers pollute, monoculture reduces biodiversity, causes soil degradation. Use organic farming",,,,
Problem,44,What is eutrophication? How does it occur?,"Eutrophication is excessive growth of algae in water bodies due to high nutrient levels. Process: 1) Fertilizers/ sewage enter water, 2) Nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) increase, 3) Algae grow rapidly, 4) Algae die and decompose, 5) Decomposition uses up oxygen, 6) Fish and other organisms die due to lack of oxygen. It disrupts aquatic ecosystems. Answer: Excessive algae growth due to nutrients, depletes oxygen, kills aquatic life",,,,
Problem,45,What is the difference between natural and artificial ecosystems?,"Natural ecosystem: Formed naturally, self-sustaining, high biodiversity, examples: Forest, ocean, lake. Artificial ecosystem: Created by humans, needs human intervention, low biodiversity, examples: Crop fields, gardens, aquariums. Natural ecosystems are more stable and complex. Answer: Natural: Formed naturally, self-sustaining, high biodiversity. Artificial: Human-made, needs intervention, low biodiversity",,,,
Problem,46,What is the importance of microorganisms in environment?,"Importance: 1) Decomposers - break down dead matter, 2) Nutrient cycling, 3) Nitrogen fixation, 4) Bioremediation - clean pollutants, 5) Food production (fermentation), 6) Maintain ecosystem balance, 7) Some are harmful (pathogens). Most are beneficial. Answer: Decompose matter, nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation, bioremediation, food production, maintain balance",,,,
Problem,47,Explain the nitrogen cycle in nature.,"Nitrogen cycle: 1) Nitrogen fixation - bacteria convert N₂ to usable forms, 2) Plants absorb nitrogen, 3) Animals get nitrogen from plants, 4) Death and decomposition return nitrogen to soil, 5) Denitrification - bacteria convert nitrogen compounds back to N₂. Nitrogen is essential for proteins and DNA. Answer: Nitrogen fixed by bacteria, used by plants/animals, returned through decomposition, cycle continues",,,,
Problem,48,What is the carbon cycle? Explain its importance.,"Carbon cycle: 1) CO₂ absorbed by plants (photosynthesis), 2) Plants make organic compounds, 3) Animals eat plants, 4) Respiration releases CO₂, 5) Death and decomposition return carbon, 6) Burning releases CO₂. Importance: Maintains CO₂ balance, essential for life, regulates climate. Human activities (burning fuels) disrupt the cycle. Answer: Carbon moves through living and non-living components. Important for CO₂ balance and climate regulation",,,,
Problem,49,What are the consequences of loss of biodiversity?,"Consequences: 1) Ecosystem instability, 2) Loss of ecosystem services, 3) Reduced resilience to changes, 4) Loss of potential medicines, 5) Food security issues, 6) Economic losses, 7) Cultural losses, 8) Disruption of food webs, 9) Climate change effects worsen.
