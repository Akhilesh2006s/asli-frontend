Equation: C₂H₅OH →(Alkaline KMnO₄) CH₃COOH. The purple color of KMnO₄ disappears. This is an oxidation reaction. Answer: C₂H₅OH → CH₃COOH (oxidation to carboxylic acid)",,,,
Problem,48,Explain why soap does not work well in hard water.,"Soap does not work well in hard water because hard water contains Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions. These ions react with soap (sodium stearate) to form insoluble precipitates (calcium stearate or magnesium stearate) instead of lather. This wastes soap and reduces cleaning efficiency. Answer: Forms insoluble salts with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, reduces lather formation",,,,
Problem,49,Explain why detergents work in hard water.,"Detergents work in hard water because they form soluble salts with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions instead of insoluble precipitates. The calcium or magnesium salts of detergents are soluble in water, so they continue to form lather and clean effectively even in hard water. Answer: Form soluble salts with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, continue to form lather",,,,
Problem,50,Write the structural formula of benzene. What type of compound is it?,"Benzene has the formula C₆H₆. Structural formula: A hexagonal ring with 6 carbon atoms, each bonded to 1 hydrogen, with alternating double and single bonds (or delocalized π-electrons). It is an aromatic compound (cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon with special stability). Answer: C₆H₆, hexagonal ring, aromatic compound",,,,
