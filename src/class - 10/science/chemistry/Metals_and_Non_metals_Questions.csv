Answer: Metals have free electrons that can move and carry electric current",,,,
Problem,2,Why are non-metals poor conductors of electricity?,"Non-metals are poor conductors of electricity because they do not have free electrons.

Answer: Atoms arranged in layers that can slide over each other",,,,
Problem,4,Explain why non-metals are brittle.,"Non-metals are brittle because their atoms are not arranged in layers like metals. When a force is applied, non-metals break rather than bend or change shape. The bonds between atoms in non-metals are directional and cannot easily slide, causing them to shatter.

Answer: Galvanization, painting, oiling, chromium plating, using alloys",,,,
Problem,18,What is galvanization? Why is it done?,"Galvanization is the process of coating iron or steel with a layer of zinc to prevent rusting. It is done because zinc acts as a protective layer. Even if the zinc coating is scratched, zinc protects iron sacrificially (zinc corrodes instead of iron) because zinc is more reactive. Answer: Coating iron with zinc to prevent rusting",,,,
Problem,19,Explain the formation of ionic bond with an example of NaCl.,"Ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal. In NaCl: Sodium (Na) has 1 valence electron, Chlorine (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. Na donates 1 electron to Cl, forming Na⁺ and Cl⁻. These oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming ionic bond: Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl. Answer: Transfer of electrons forms ions, oppositely charged ions attract",,,,
Problem,20,Explain why ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points.,"Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points because they have strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions. A large amount of energy is required to break these strong bonds. Therefore, they have high melting and boiling points. Answer: Strong electrostatic forces between ions require large energy to break",,,,
Problem,21,Explain why ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten state but not in solid state.,"In solid state, ions are fixed in position and cannot move, so no electric current flows.

Answer: Extracted by electrolysis of molten compounds",,,,
Problem,29,Explain the extraction of metals in the middle of reactivity series.,"Metals in the middle of reactivity series (Zn, Fe, Pb) are extracted by reduction of their oxides with carbon (coke) or carbon monoxide.

Problem,30,Explain why metals at the bottom of reactivity series are found in free state.,"Metals at the bottom of reactivity series (Cu, Ag, Au) are found in free state because they are least reactive. They do not react easily with air, water, or other substances, so they remain uncombined in nature. For example, gold and silver are found as native metals. Answer: Least reactive, don't combine with other elements",,,,
Problem,31,Write the balanced equation for the reaction of magnesium with dilute sulphuric acid.,"Magnesium reacts with dilute sulphuric acid to form magnesium sulphate and hydrogen gas. Balanced equation: Mg + H₂SO₄ → MgSO₄ + H₂. Answer: Mg + H₂SO₄ → MgSO₄ + H₂",,,,
Problem,32,What happens when zinc is added to iron sulphate solution? Why?,"Zinc does not react with iron sulphate solution because zinc is more reactive than iron. A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal, but not vice versa. Since zinc is above iron in reactivity series, zinc can displace iron, but if zinc is added to iron sulphate, nothing happens because zinc is already more reactive. Actually, wait - if zinc is added to iron sulphate, zinc should displace iron. Let me correct: When zinc is added to iron sulphate, zinc displaces iron: Zn + FeSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Fe. Answer: Zn + FeSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Fe (zinc displaces iron)",,,,
Problem,33,What happens when iron is added to zinc sulphate solution? Why?,"When iron is added to zinc sulphate solution, no reaction occurs because iron is less reactive than zinc.

Problem,41,Why do metals lose electrons to form positive ions?,"Metals lose electrons to form positive ions because they have 1, 2, or 3 valence electrons. It is easier for them to lose these few electrons to achieve a stable noble gas configuration. By losing electrons, they form cations (positive ions) and become stable. Answer: Have few valence electrons, easier to lose and achieve stable configuration",,,,
Problem,42,Why do non-metals gain electrons to form negative ions?,"Non-metals gain electrons to form negative ions because they have 4, 5, 6, or 7 valence electrons. It is easier for them to gain electrons (to complete octet) rather than lose many electrons. By gaining electrons, they form anions (negative ions) and achieve stable noble gas configuration. Answer: Have 4-7 valence electrons, easier to gain electrons to complete octet",,,,
Problem,43,What is the reaction of metals with chlorine? Give an example.,"Metals react with chlorine to form ionic chlorides (metal chlorides). Example: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl.

Zn + S → ZnS (zinc sulphide). These reactions require heating. Answer: Form metal sulphides. Example: Fe + S → FeS",,,,
Problem,45,Explain why ionic compounds are hard and brittle.,"Ionic compounds are hard because of strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions. They are brittle because when a force is applied, the layers of ions shift. This brings like charges together, causing repulsion and the crystal breaks. Answer: Hard due to strong forces, brittle because layers shift causing like charges to repel",,,,
Problem,46,What happens when a piece of sodium is dropped in water?,"When sodium is dropped in water, it reacts violently: 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂.

Potassium reacts most violently, followed by sodium, then lithium. All produce metal hydroxide and hydrogen: 2M + 2H₂O → 2MOH + H₂. Answer: Reactivity increases: Li < Na < K, all produce MOH and H₂",,,,
Problem,48,Explain why copper vessels develop a green coating when exposed to air.,"Copper vessels develop a green coating (patina) when exposed to moist air. This is due to formation of basic copper carbonate: 2Cu + H₂O + CO₂ + O₂ → Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂. The green coating is copper carbonate which protects the metal underneath.
