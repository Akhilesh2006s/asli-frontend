Answer: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu (displacement reaction)",,,,
Reaction,47,What happens when silver nitrate solution is added to sodium chloride solution? Write the balanced equation.,"When silver nitrate is added to sodium chloride, a white precipitate of silver chloride is formed. This is a double displacement (precipitation) reaction. Balanced equation: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃. Answer: White precipitate of AgCl is formed. AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃",,,,
Reaction,48,What happens when hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through copper sulphate solution? Write the balanced equation.,"When hydrogen sulphide is passed through copper sulphate solution, a black precipitate of copper sulphide is formed. Balanced equation: H₂S + CuSO₄ → CuS + H₂SO₄. Answer: Black precipitate of CuS is formed. H₂S + CuSO₄ → CuS + H₂SO₄",,,,
Reaction,49,Write the balanced equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid.,"Sodium hydroxide + Hydrochloric acid → Sodium chloride + Water. Balanced equation: NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O. This is a neutralization reaction. Answer: NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O (neutralization reaction)",,,,
Reaction,50,Write the balanced equation for the thermal decomposition of lead nitrate.,"Lead nitrate decomposes on heating to form lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen. Balanced equation: 2Pb(NO₃)₂ → 2PbO + 4NO₂ + O₂. This is a thermal decomposition reaction. Answer: 2Pb(NO₃)₂ → 2PbO + 4NO₂ + O₂ (thermal decomposition)",,,,
